This is my fourth challenge completed but my first challenge with Javascript. I'm getting a lot better with HTML and CSS, 
but Javascript is still a challenge. I hope to complete more of these challenges as personal projects because it was good practice 
for applying JS to real life applications rather than just practicing in tutorials. I felt pretty accomplished completing this with 
a bit of help. But as always, all input is appreciated.
